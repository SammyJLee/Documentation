## What do we do in meetings?

Meetings are an excellent way to check in with all members about the following:

- How is the project developing? Progress updates are essential.
- Are people on track? Make sure the task schedule is being followed.
- Does the team agree with the work being done? Make sure you have consensus through discussion.
- Is the workload distribution fair? Make sure everyone is happy with task allocation.
- Are there any issues that needs addressing/resolving? Clear up issues in meetings.
- Are all members contributing to the best of their abilities?
- Do any members need extra help/clarification? Should the team help or should the member consult the instructor?
- What is the next stage of work that we'll discuss in the next meeting?

You'll receive templates of what to include, but the basics of meetings are action: *what have we done, what will we do, who will do it, by when*?


Do not leave any issues unresolved; work on them (with instructor help as needed) right away!

For meetings to work well, you should have a pre-set agenda.

## Agendas

What is the agenda? What is the agenda goal? 

The agenda is a short list of topics that you will work on in the meeting.

The main goal of the agenda is to decide what you want to get done at the meeting.

In the meeting itself, you can add any new information that is not on the list, but one goal of the agenda is to make sure all the important information you need to discuss is included beforehand.

### What goes in the agenda?

Agendas can include:

- **Information**: For example, this could be updates on work.
- **Action items**: what actions do you want to review and what actions do you want to set? For example, Sunny will conduct user tests on March 12
- **Discussion**: what things do you want the team to discuss? For example, do we all like the graphics? Do we need to change the order of navigation links?

### Who is involved in the agenda?

One person each meeting should be responsible for the agenda, and everyone in the team should and can add to the agenda. 

The person responsible for the agenda should get feedback from all teammates on what they’d like to include in the next meeting.
This feedback can be sent via email or other communication channel. It can look like this sample below:

### What happens next? 

The person responsible for the agenda should then update the following document, share it with teammates (your choice of communication) and bring it to the meeting.

### Agenda Template

Use this template for all your meeting agendas.

The person responsible needs to complete it fully, send to all teammates (using communication tool of your choice) and instructors (Learning Hub Assignments, Agendas), and the Chair needs to bring it to the next meeting.

### Agenda Item Explanations

Similar to email subject lines, agenda items are phrases, not sentences. They should make the topic/task clear, and they’re often focused on action.

**Approval of Agenda**. This is a standard item, so simply copy it as the #1 item for each meeting’s agenda. It allows members to either approve the topics or change them as the first meeting action. Every agenda (including the first one) should have this item first.

**Approval of Minutes**. This is a standard item, so copy it as the #2 item for each meeting’s agenda. It allows members to change/correct any problems they noticed with the meeting minutes from the last meeting. Every agenda (except the first one) should have this item second.

**Progress Reports on items from past meeting**. List any topics from the past meeting that needed follow up, and what the outcome was.

For example, perhaps the last meeting agenda had a “Review Draft Graphics” agenda topic under New Work. During the meeting, the team decided that Min and Susie needed to add sources to their graphics (and they recorded this in the minutes under new work). The agenda would have “Review Draft Graphics” under “Past Meeting Items” (because the item isn’t finished) to see what the outcome was.

Keep this on the agenda so that everyone can report on past work items.

**New Work Items**. This is where you’ll list any new work items that you’ll discuss in the next meeting and how much time you think each will take.

**Any other business**. This is standard, so add it to the agenda.

**Next Meeting**. This is a standard agenda item, so  copy it as the #6 item for each week’s agenda. It’s just to allow members to decide the date, time, and location for the next meeting.
