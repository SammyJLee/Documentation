## Task One â€“ Creating Your Server

The first step to hosting a website is creating the server that will store the sites files.
Currently, the best server for small websites is the $5/month plan on Digital Ocean.
We will show you how to setup this server in a few simple steps.


Login to DigitalOcean.com

Go to the top-right corner and click the _Create Droplet_ button


> Note: Ubuntu is the operating system that the server will run on. It is free to use,
and one of the most commonly used operating systems to run servers.

Select _Ubuntu_ under the distributions tab.

> Warning: If you do not choose the $5/month option, you could be billed a larger
amount for the server.

Scroll down to the _Choose a size_ option and select the _$ 5 /mo_ size.


> Note: You may choose any datacenter location below. The Toronto option was
simply chosen for these instructions.

Scroll down to the *Choose a datacenter region* option and select _Toronto._

Scroll down to the *Finalize and create* option and name your Droplet.

Click the *Create* button to finalize and complete the droplet setup.
