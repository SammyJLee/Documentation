### Establishing your group meeting rules

The goal of setting these rules is to have successful meetings by establishing the way you want them to run. You can encourage positive communication and stop meetings turning into a waste of people's time. 

The start of your project is a great opportunity to decdie how you as a group want meetings to run. We'd rather you set the foundations for good meetings now, so that you don't go back to meetings that were unfocused, poorly organised, and unsatisfactory in any way. 

Use the process that follows to decide as a group - and it must come from the whole group - how you want to work with each other in meetings. If you have a role in setting the protocols, you may be more likely to stick to them. 

### Steps to Meeting Protocol

1. Think of a meeting in your past that has worked well or not worked well. 
2. In the Google Doc, write down any and all examples of positive and negative behaviours you have seen at those meetings. 
3. As a team, identify which of the examples could be adopted - and which should be avoided - for the new project. 
4. Create a new Google Doc entitled "[Insert Team Name] Meeting Protocols" and co-create your meeting rules. You can use bullets for the doc. 
5. Each person sign the document to show you will stick to these rules. 
6. Create a folder called Team Integration Manual and place the doc in there. 
6. Share folder with your instructors by DM and upload to Learning Hub.
