Subject: **Mandatory New Travel Refund Process**

Attachment: Expense form

Sales Reps:

All sales representatives now must follow some new procedures for travel expenses. Many sales reps have been submitting beat-up or late receipts, and this is a real pain. If representatives don’t follow the new steps below, they won’t get their cash!

* **Before Booking Trip**: Reps must read the company travel expense policy before booking. Otherwise, you’ll probably book the wrong plane tickets or hotels and won’t get a refund. You’ve been trying to claim insanely luxurious expenses like first-class flights, and that’s not cool! We gave you a copy of the policy when you were hired. If you’ve lost it, you’ll have to bug your Sales Manager for a new one.

* **During the Trip**: We absolutely won’t refund torn, damaged and illegible receipts, so you’d better keep them in good condition! Go ahead and order a receipt wallet from the Purchasing and Supplies Department.

* **After the Trip**: You have to completely fill out the new expense form to get any refunds now. Make sure you attach all of your receipts. You must also send it in within 60 days after your trip.

Again, these new procedures are mandatory, so you must follow them if you want to get your hard-earned cash back! If there’s anything you can’t understand or you have complaints, you can email me.
